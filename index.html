However, there are still many things I need to learn in order to pursue this career. There are many ways I can do this: taking another Computer Science course in High School, study or use online resources, and practice in actually designing the layouts of websites. I think the development of a full web-page just from text is extremely interesting - being able to create an interactive format from nothing but my fingertips.

Experiences I possess are the Dublin High School science fair; this helped me learn to patiently design and develop, as well as cooperate with others by using and giving feedback. I also participated in the Computer Science club during Freshman year of high school. This club taught me the basics for computer engineering principles, and made me ready to pursue a career in computer sciences.
